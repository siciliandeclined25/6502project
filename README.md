## Welcome to Apple1Py
Apple1Py is a 6502 assembler and emulator written in Python, designed in order to make Apple 1 development easy. It contains a fully self written assembler and modular specifications for ease of programming.

## Tools

### LBAD
Standing for Lucas' Bad Assembler/Debugger, a built in 6502 Assembler and Debugger for Apple 1 systems. designed to use as little shortcuts as possible and achieve the minimum amount of code to account for the 4K of programming

### Apple1Py
A 6502 emulator built from the ground up, specifically designed with Apple 1 configurations in mind and the ability to emulate the display of the Apple 1.
