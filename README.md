** 6502 Processor **

This is a pet project to make a fully functional 6502 instruction set and hardware emulation for an Apple 1 (eventually) in Python3.

** What's the point? **

I want to do something and work on a project in EECS 169 so this is it

** What works? **
As of the initial commit:

LDA
STA
NOP

** What's the end goal again? **
To run wozmod and maybe even Apple 1 basic as was run once on Apple machines. This could be a really cool (slow) way to emulate on less capable machines that run Python.
